Linux kernel patch to recognize TIVO version of APM partitions.
Both LE and BE drives are detected and partition devices are created.
Patch tested on Debian 10 4.19.x kernel.
Patch should work for all 5.x kernels since APM recognizer hasn't changed.

* tivo_apm_recognizer.patch

Apply patch to source tree and re-build kernel package(s).
